 # <Horiseon Social Solution Services>


## Horiseon is a search engine optimization, on line reputation management and social media marketing company.  They desired a UI that showcased their company.


- The optimal reason for doing this project was to better understand the various actions and forms each html tag and css code can take.  It provided a fun puzzle to find all the pieces, match them up to the existing code, cut out the parts that didn't make any sense or were not achieving the desired result and streamline the process.


- As a dev, I wanted the challenge of figuring out how much I could streamline without losing any functionality or quality of the asthetics, yet adding in accessibility for screen readers.  I come from the background of nursing and have my own invisible illness.  Daily living with an illness people don't easily understand makes me very aware of the others around me with their own struggles. Making things more accessible for those with disabilities is something I would like to see happen more often because of that.


- This website came with several functions already built into it, only the written paragraphs were accessable to a screen reader.  As a dev, I loved figuring out what things I could add that would help someone access the page better.  I kept thinking about how amazing it would be to have someone come across a page that I worked on and be able to understand it, thanks to the things I built into it.  I tried to make my descriptions understandable, but consise.


- I learned that googling error messages can help you learn a multitude of things.  I learned not to give up, but be understanding to myself when my body and brain needed breaks.  Most of all, I learned to have a flexible mindset when it came to solving challenges, as there are multiple ways to solve each problem!  Lastly, there are still more things to learn, as I'm sure I could have done a lot more with this project if I had more time to research.
